# API Personal Finance Planning and MonteCarlo Simulator

In this project we will be using APIs (Alpaca) to retrieve curring data about stock and cryptocurrency prices. After I retrieve this current data I will create a portfolio with fake values of BTC, ETH, AGG, and SPY. Using these values I will show my total portfolio value, create saving df, and set and ideal emergency fund.

After this I will run Retirment simulations using APIs (Alpaca) once again to retrieve curring data about the stocks in my portfolio. In this retirement planning section I will use MonteCarlo to predict the next 30 years of my portfolio and show the statistics. Once this is completed I will run the MonteCarlo simulator multiple times to see different scenarios.
